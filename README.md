### **The Spam Sniffer: SMS Spam Detection System**  
**The Spam Sniffer** is a machine learning-based project designed to accurately classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. This project addresses the widespread issue of spam messages by providing an efficient and scalable solution for spam detection.

#### **Project Highlights**  
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a labeled dataset of SMS messages categorized as spam or non-spam.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performs essential cleaning and transformation steps, including:  
  - Removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords.  
  - Tokenization and text normalization.  
  - Feature extraction using techniques like **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
- **Model Building**: Implements the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm for text classification.  
- **Output**: Exports the trained model and vectorizer as serialized files (`model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`) for seamless deployment.  

#### **Technologies and Tools**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
